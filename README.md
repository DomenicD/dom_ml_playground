# dom_ml_playground
This is a collection of demos, tutorials, and experiments that I used or made
while learning Machine Learning. There will be an emphasis on Neural Networks
and Deep Learning.

## Dependencies



## Setup
In order to run the "if __name__ == '__main__':" code at the bottom of some of 
the scripts, you will need to add this git project directory to a system
variable called PYTHONPATH.
